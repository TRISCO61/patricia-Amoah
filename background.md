# THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON FARMING IN NOVA SCOTIA
*A Decision Intelligence Anakysis of the Impact of Climate Change on Farming in Nova Scotia*

## Introduction
Climate change is reshaping agricultural systems across the globe, and Nova Scotia is no exception. As a province with a diverse agricultural landscape—from fruit orchards in the Annapolis Valley to dairy and mixed farming operations—Nova Scotia’s farming communities are already feeling the effects of rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasingly unpredictable weather events. These shifts are not only threatening crop productivity but are also adding financial and operational strain to farmers.

## Problem Context
Nova Scotia’s agriculture is increasingly affected by changing climate patterns, including earlier springs, prolonged droughts, and unpredictable rainfall. As a coastal province, it also faces unique risks like sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. These shifts are disrupting traditional farming practices and threatening the sustainability of rural communities that rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods and food security.

### Some Challenges
Farming in Nova Scotia faces a growing list of climate-related challenges:
* Extreme weather (e.g., droughts, floods, hurricanes) is becoming more frequent and damaging.
  
* Soil health and fertility are at risk due to erosion, saltwater intrusion (in coastal zones), and nutrient leaching from heavy rainfall.
  
* Water management is becoming more complex, with prolonged dry spells followed by intense storms.
  
* Pest and disease pressures are increasing due to warmer and longer growing seasons.
  
* Economic uncertainty due to crop loss, reduced yields, and fluctuating market prices has placed additional stress on farmers.
  
These realities highlight the urgent need for adaptive strategies, sustainable practices, and informed policy responses.

## Importance of the Study
This study is critical for several reasons:
1. Food security: Local food production is vital for the province's food system resilience.
   
2. Economic impact: Agriculture contributes significantly to Nova Scotia's economy and rural employment.
   
3. Policy guidance: Understanding climate impacts helps shape effective government support and climate-resilient policies.
   
4. Sustainability: It informs the shift toward sustainable farming practices, reducing long-term environmental degradation.
   
By focusing on Nova Scotia specifically, this study helps bridge a regional knowledge gap and supports locally relevant solutions.

## Potential Datasets
Some potential datasets will include:
* Nova Scotia Climate Change Projections (CMIP5) 
Provides long-term climate model projections (e.g. temperature and precipitation) for Nova Scotia and its counties, helping assess future climate risks for agriculture.

* Nova Scotia Farm Registration by Commodity 
Offers data on the number and types of farms registered in Nova Scotia, useful for understanding the scale and distribution of agricultural activity.

* Canadian Drought Monitor 
A national tool that tracks and reports drought conditions across Canada monthly, offering insight into water stress affecting Nova Scotia farms.

* Historical Weather & Climate Data 
Contains detailed records of temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables over time—ideal for trend analysis in agricultural research.

* GreenHouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Agriculture 
Reports emissions related to farming practices, useful for understanding agriculture's contribution to climate change and mitigation opportunities.

These datasets can support trend analysis, risk assessment, and evidence-based recommendations for adaptation strategies.

## Conclusion
Climate change is already altering the landscape of farming in Nova Scotia, with profound effects on environmental, economic, and social systems. Understanding these impacts—through clear data, community engagement, and focused research—is essential for ensuring the long-term resilience and viability of the province’s agricultural sector. This study serves as a call to action for policymakers, farmers, and researchers to work collaboratively toward a more climate-resilient agricultural future.
