THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH FREQUENT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS IN NOVA SCOTIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Climate change is significantly threats to coastal communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. This term project highlight on climate change in nova scotia its key impact and how the issue of climate change is been addressed in nova scotia, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, coastal erosion, and changes in biodiversity. The research also explores the potential economic and social consequences of these changes.
In Nova Scotia, climate change is leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, including stronger storms, coastal flooding, wildfires, heatwaves, and heavier rainfall, primarily due to rising sea levels, warmer ocean temperatures, and altered precipitation patterns, putting coastal communities and infrastructure at significant risk; this is further compounded by the province's long coastline, making it particularly vulnerable to storm surges and erosion. 

Key Performance indicators
•	Coastal Flooding:
Rising sea levels combined with storm surges from stronger storms are causing increased coastal flooding, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas. 
•	Erosion:
Coastal erosion is accelerating due to rising sea levels and increased wave action from stronger storms, impacting property and natural ecosystems. 
•	Intensified Storms:
Hurricanes and other tropical storms are expected to become more frequent and intense due to warmer ocean temperatures, leading to heavier rainfall and stronger winds. 
•	Heatwaves:
Warmer temperatures are resulting in more frequent and severe heatwaves, posing health risks to vulnerable populations. 
•	Wildfires:
Increased dry conditions due to warmer temperatures can contribute to more frequent and severe wildfires. 
•	Changes in Precipitation:
More precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow, leading to potential flooding events. 
•	Impact on Marine Ecosystems:
Warmer ocean temperatures and increased acidity can negatively affect marine life and fisheries. 

How Nova Scotia is addressing these impacts:
•	Climate Change Adaptation Plans:
The Nova Scotia government has developed climate change adaptation plans to address the impacts of extreme weather events, including coastal protection strategies and community preparedness initiatives.
•	Coastal Development Regulations:
Implementing stricter regulations on coastal development to reduce vulnerability to flooding and erosion.
•	Infrastructure Upgrades:
Investing in infrastructure improvements to better withstand extreme weather events, such as flood defenses and resilient building codes.
•	Public Awareness Campaigns:
