Executive Summary
Climate change poses significant challenges to Nova Scotia's agricultural sector, impacting crop yields, farm operations, and economic stability. Farmers are experiencing more frequent extreme weather events, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and temperature fluctuations, which affect soil health, water availability, and crop productivity. In response, the provincial government and various organizations have initiated projects to enhance climate resilience in agriculture, such as funding climate adaptation coordinators and supporting wetland restoration projects. 
Research Objectives
To examine the effects of climate change on agricultural practices in Nova Scotia, with a focus on temperature shifts, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events.

To identify the specific challenges faced by farmers in Nova Scotia due to climate change, including soil degradation, water management issues, and pest and disease outbreaks.

To assess the socio-economic implications of climate-related disruptions on rural communities, including impacts on food security, livelihoods, and market stability.

To evaluate existing adaptive strategies and policy responses aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change on agriculture in the region.

To explore and recommend sustainable farming practices and data-driven approaches for improving resilience in Nova Scotia’s agricultural sector.

To utilize regional climate and agricultural datasets for conducting risk assessments and informing evidence-based policy and farming decisions.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
To assess and guide the adaptation efforts in Nova Scotia's agriculture sector, the following KPIs are essential:
Crop Yield Variability: Monitoring changes in the yields of key crops to evaluate the impact of climate conditions and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies.
Soil Health Metrics: Assessing soil organic matter content, erosion rates, and moisture levels to understand soil resilience under changing climatic conditions.
Water Usage Efficiency: Measuring the efficiency of water use in irrigation practices to ensure sustainable water management amid variable precipitation patterns.
Adoption Rate of Climate-Resilient Practices: Tracking the implementation of practices such as crop diversification, cover cropping, and conservation tillage that enhance resilience to climate impacts.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture: Quantifying emissions to identify opportunities for reduction and to monitor progress toward sustainability goals. 
Economic Impact Assessments: Evaluating the financial implications of climate change on farming operations, including costs related to crop losses, infrastructure damage, and adaptation investments.
Available Datasets
Several datasets are available to support the monitoring of these KPIs:
Nova Scotia Climate Change Projections (CMIP5): Provides climate projections for the province and its counties, useful for assessing future climate scenarios. 
Farm Registration by Commodity: Offers data on farm registrations categorized by commodity, aiding in understanding the distribution and scale of various agricultural activities. 
Canadian Drought Monitor: Delivers monthly assessments of drought conditions across Canada, including Nova Scotia, which is crucial for evaluating water availability and planning. 
Historical Climate Data: Environment and Climate Change Canada provides access to historical climate data, supporting analyses of climate trends and their correlation with agricultural outputs. 
Utilizing these KPIs and datasets enables stakeholders to make informed decisions, develop effective adaptation strategies, and enhance the resilience of Nova Scotia's agricultural sector in the face of climate change.
